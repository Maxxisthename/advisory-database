  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblk-mq: don't touch ->tagset in blk_mq_get_sq_hctx\n\nblk_mq_run_hw_queues() could be run when there isn't queued request and\nafter queue is cleaned up, at that time tagset is freed, because tagset\nlifetime is covered by driver, and often freed after blk_cleanup_queue()\nreturns.\n\nSo don't touch ->tagset for figuring out current default hctx by the mapping\nbuilt in request queue, so use-after-free on tagset can be avoided. Meantime\nthis way should be fast than retrieving mapping from tagset.",
