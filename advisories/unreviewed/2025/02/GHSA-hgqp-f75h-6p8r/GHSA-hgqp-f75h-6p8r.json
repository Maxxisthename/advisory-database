  "details": "A vulnerability in the implementation of the internal system processes of Cisco APIC could allow an authenticated, local attacker to access sensitive information on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials.\n\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient masking of sensitive information that is displayed through system CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using reconnaissance techniques at the device CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive information on an affected device that could be used for additional attacks.",
