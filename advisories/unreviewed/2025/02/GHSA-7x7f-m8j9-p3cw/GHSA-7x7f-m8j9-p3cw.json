  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath12k: fix read pointer after free in ath12k_mac_assign_vif_to_vdev()\n\nIn ath12k_mac_assign_vif_to_vdev(), if arvif is created on a different\nradio, it gets deleted from that radio through a call to\nath12k_mac_unassign_link_vif(). This action frees the arvif pointer.\nSubsequently, there is a check involving arvif, which will result in a\nread-after-free scenario.\n\nFix this by moving this check after arvif is again assigned via call to\nath12k_mac_assign_link_vif().\n\nTested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.3.1-00173-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1",
